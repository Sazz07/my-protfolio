                My Journey
              </h2>
              <div className='space-y-4 text-muted-foreground'>
                <p>
                  My path to becoming a software developer began with a
                  curiosity about how digital experiences are created. While
                  studying Computer Science at Northern University Bangladesh, I
                  discovered my passion for web development through building
                  small projects and experimenting with different technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After graduating in 2022, I joined Repliq Limited as a
                  Frontend Developer where I had the opportunity to work on
                  real-world projects and collaborate with experienced
                  developers. This experience taught me not just technical
                  skills, but also the importance of teamwork, communication,
                  and delivering user-centered solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2024, I took on a new challenge as a Software Developer at
                  Tutors Finland Oy, where I've been expanding my skills in
                  full-stack development and working with a globally distributed
                  team. Each step of my journey has deepened my appreciation for
                  clean code, thoughtful design, and the impact that
                  well-crafted digital experiences can have.

                <p>
                  I approach software development as both a science and an art.
                  The technical implementation needs to be solid, efficient, and
                  maintainable, but the user experience should also be
                  intuitive, engaging, and even delightful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When tackling a new project, I start by understanding the core
                  problem and user needs before diving into code. I believe in
                  the power of planning and thoughtful architecture, but also in
                  the importance of iteration and feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm particularly passionate about creating responsive,
                  accessible interfaces that work well for everyone, and I enjoy
                  the challenge of optimizing performance to deliver smooth
                  experiences even in constrained environments.

                <p>
                  When I'm not in front of a computer, you might find me
                  exploring photography, reading about design and technology
                  trends, or enjoying a good cup of coffee. I believe that
                  diverse interests and experiences enrich my perspective as a
                  developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm also passionate about mentoring and sharing knowledge. I
                  regularly participate in local tech meetups and occasionally
                  contribute to open-source projects. I find that teaching
                  others often deepens my own understanding and keeps me
                  connected to the broader developer community.

                  As I continue to grow as a developer, I'm particularly excited
                  about deepening my expertise in modern web frameworks,
                  exploring more advanced state management patterns, and
                  learning more about cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm also interested in the intersection of design and
                  development, and how tools and processes can bridge these
                  disciplines to create more cohesive products. In the long
                  term, I aspire to lead development teams and contribute to
                  products that make a meaningful difference in people's lives.
